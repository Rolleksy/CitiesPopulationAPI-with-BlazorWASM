# CitiesPopulationAPI
Minimal API created in C#, connected to local SQL server.
Database has basic CRUD functions in the form of stored procedures.

This repo consists of simple API, which allows manipulation of data in connected SQL DB.

Data model consists of:
- **City name** - string
- **Population number** - int



## Idea behind project and possible future additions
The idea was to create simple API, that could be repurposed in case of bigger or more complicated projects.

For now it allows storage and management of data about cities and their population.
